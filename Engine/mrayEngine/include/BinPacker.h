	// rects : An array containing the width and height of each input rect in

	// sequence, i.e. [w0][h0][w1][h1][w2][h2]... The IDs for the rects are

	// derived from the order in which they appear in the array.



	// packs : After packing, the outer array contains the packs (therefore

	// the number of packs is packs.size()). Each inner array contains a

	// sequence of sets of 4 ints. Each set represents a rectangle in the

	// pack. The elements in the set are 1) the rect ID, 2) the x position

	// of the rect with respect to the pack, 3) the y position of the rect

	// with respect to the pack, and 4) whether the rect was rotated (1) or

	// not (0). The widths and heights of the rects are not included, as it's

	// assumed they are stored on the caller's side (they were after all the

	// input to the function).



	// allowRotation : when true (the default value), the packer is allowed

	// the option of rotating the rects in the process of trying to fit them

	// into the current working area.
